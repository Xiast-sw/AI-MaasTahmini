# Salary Prediction with Artificial Intelligence

This project uses artificial intelligence to make salary predictions based on various features. The dataset is randomly generated, and salary estimates are made by considering several factors.

## Dataset

The dataset includes features such as employees' education level, years of experience, and position. These features are used to predict salaries.

## Artificial Intelligence Model

The project uses a Polynomial Linear Regression algorithm to create an AI model. This model makes salary predictions based on features such as employees' experience and education level. Polynomial regression is an extended form of linear regression and is used to capture more complex relationships within the data. This model is particularly effective when there are nonlinear relationships in the dataset.
